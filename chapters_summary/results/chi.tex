\label{sec:LEP_methodology}

Three types of flows are analysed:
\begin{itemize}
\item in particle flow all particles are assigned a weight equal to 1.0,
\item in energy flow particles are assigned a weight proportional to their energy normalised to the sum of the energy of the top quarks,
\item in \pt flow particles are assigned a weight proportional to their transverse momentum normalised to the transverse momentum of the respective jet.
\end{itemize}

The results of the LEP methodology using particle flow are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:chi_allconst_N} with all jet constituents and in Fig.~\ref{fig:chi_chconst_N} including only charged jet constituents. The flow is plotted between the leading \cPqb jet \leadingb and the 2nd leading \cPqb jet \scndleadingb, the hadronic \cPqb jet $j_{\text{h}}^{\cPqb}$ and the furthest light quark $j_{\text{f}}^{\PW}$ (jet distance is measured with the angle between the spatial components of the 4-vectors of the jets), the closest light quark $j_{\text{c}}^{\PW}$ and the hadronic \cPqb jet $j_{\text{h}}^{\cPqb}$, and the leading light jet \leadingjet and the second leading light jet \scndleadingjet.

In all cases the density drops in the middle area between jets compared to the jet centre with the central density varying between colour connect jets and jets not connected in colour.

The bin-per-bin ratios of the flow in colour-free regions (\leadingb, \scndleadingb), ($j_{\text{h}}^{\cPqb}$, $j_{\text{f}}^{\PW}$), ($j_{\text{c}}^{\PW}$, $j_{\text{h}}^{\cPqb}$) to the flow in the colour-connected region (\leadingjet, \scndleadingjet) are given in Fig.~\ref{fig:chirg_allconst_N} including all jet constituents and Fig.~\ref{fig:chirg_chconst_N} including only charged jet constituents. Significant colour reconnection is noticeable in the region ($j_{\text{c}}^{\PW}$, $j_{\text{h}}^{\cPqb}$) assuming the colour octet \PW model.

Fig.~\ref{fig:ratio_hbqc} shows the bin-per-bin ratio of the particle flow in the region (\leadingjet, \scndleadingjet) in the SM model to the particle flow in the region (\leadingjet, \scndleadingjet) in the colour octet \PW model. A loss of colour connection in this region in the colour octet \PW model is evident.

As a quantitative result from the LEP methodology one can use the parameter $R$ which is defined as the ratio between the integral from 0.2 to 0.8 in the colour connected region to the integral from 0.2 to 0.8 in the region not connected in colour:

\begin{equation}
R=\frac{\int_{0.2}^{0.8}f^{\text{inter \PW region}}d\chi}{\int_{0.2}^{0.8}f^{\text{intra \PW region}}d\chi},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $f(\chi)$ is the density of the flow distribution.

This parameter was used at LEP to quantify colour connection effects and their values from different experiment corresponding to 625~\pbinv of data in the range \sqrts=189\textendash209~\GeV are given in Table~\ref{tab:LEP_R}. We note inconsistency in the $R$ values reported by different experiments. Furthermore, $R$ should exceed 1 on theoretical basis. The range 0.2-0.8 is identified as sensitive to colour-connection effects.

  \end{tabular}
\end{table} 

In our case we use 3 $R$ values for any of the regions not connected in colour with normalisation to the colour connected region (\leadingjet, \scndleadingjet).

The integral of particle flow from 0.2 to 0.8 in different regions and the inverse of $R$ values for the SM model is given Table~\ref{tab:R_L_reco_N_MC_SM}, for data in Table~\ref{tab:R_L_reco_N_data_SM} and for the \PW colour octet model in Table~\ref{tab:R_L_reco_N_MC_cflip}.
