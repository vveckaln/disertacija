The groundwork for this work was done in the scope of the Picosecond Siliconphotomultiplier-Electronics-Crystal research Marie-Curie Network project. I am thankful to Etiennette Auffray (CERN, Switzerland) for organising this project. I am also thankful to Michele Gallinaro (LIP, Portugal) for providing guidance for my initial work in the CMS experiment.

I am also thankful to my team members Martijn Mulders (CERN, Switzerland), Pedro Silva (CERN, Switzerland) and Markus Seidel (CERN, Switzerland) for providing guidance and sharing experience.

I am also thankful for the relentless support of Rīgas Tehniskā universitāte, Latvia which allowed to continue my work at the CMS experiment.
