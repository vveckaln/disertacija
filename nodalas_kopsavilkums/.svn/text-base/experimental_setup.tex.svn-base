The CMS detector is composed of the following layers starting from the beam axis - a silicon pixel and strip  tracker, a lead tungstate electromagnetic calorimeter, a brass and a plastic scintillator hadron calorimeter, a superconducting magnet producing 3.8 - 4.0T of magnetic field, and a gas-ionisation muon spectrometer \cite{Chatrchyan:2008aa}.

Starting from the beam interaction region, particles first enter a tracker, in which charged-particle trajectories (tracks) and origins (vertices) are reconstructed from signals (hits) in the sensitive layers.  The tracker is immersed in a magnetic field that bends the trajectories and allows the electric charges and momenta of charged particles to be measured. Electrons and photons are then absorbed in an electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL). The corresponding electromagnetic showers are detected as clusters of energy recorded in neighbouring cells, from which the energy and direction of the particles can be determined.  Charged and neutral hadrons may initiate a hadronic shower in the ECAL as well, which is subsequently fully absorbed in the hadron calorimeter (HCAL). The corresponding clusters are used to estimate their energies and directions.  Muons and neutrinos traverse the calorimeters with little or no interactions. While neutrinos escape undetected, muons produce hits in additional tracking layers called muon detectors, located outside the calorimeters. This simplified view is graphically summarized in Fig.  \ref{fig:CMSpf}, which displays a sketch of a transverse slice of the CMS detector.

A significantly improved event description can be achieved by correlating the basic elements from all detector layers (tracks and clusters) to identify each final-state particle, and by combining the corresponding measurements to reconstruct the particle properties on the basis of this identification. This holistic approach is called particle-flow (PF) reconstruction \cite{Sirunyan:2017ulk}.

The fine-granularity and fast response tracker (\cite{Karimaki:368412}, \cite{tracker_addendum}) is an important segment in resolving the fine jet constituents. It is closely aligned to the beam axis and has a length of 5.8 m and radius of 2.5 m. The CMS solenoid provides a homogeneous and coaxial magnetic field of 3.8 - 4.0 T over the full volume of the tracker. At radius below 10 cm a hit rate at the order of $100\frac{kHz}{\text{mm}^2}$ is encountered. In order to achieve the desired resolution 100$\mu$m $\times$ 150$\mu$m pixel detectors are used. At a higher radius the reduced particle flux allows the use of silicon micro-strip detectors with a typical size of 10cm $\times$ 80$\mu$m to 25 cm $\times$ 150$\mu$m, the size increasing with an increasing radius. There are 66 million pixels with $\frac{1}{\text{m}^2}$ active area in the pixel detector and 9.3 million strips and 193 m${}^2$ active area in the strip detector.

The electromagnetic calorimeter of CMS (ECAL) is a hermetic homogeneous calorimeter made of 61 200 lead tungstate ($\text{PbWO}_{4}$) crystals mounted in the central barrel part, closed by 7 324 crystals in each of the two endcaps. The barrel part covers the pseudorapidity range $\left|\eta\right|<1.479$ while the encaps cover the pseudrapidity range $1.479<\left|\eta\right|<3.0$. A preshower detector is placed in front of the endcap crystals. Avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are used as photodetectors in the barrel and vacuum phototriodes (VPTs) in the endcaps. The $\text{PbWO}_{4}$ crystals exhibit characteristics that make them an appropriate choice for an electromagnetic calorimeter at the LHC. The high density 8.28$\frac{\text{g}}{\text{cm}^3}$, short radiation length (0.89 cm)  and small Moliere radius (2.2cm) result in a fine granularity and a compact calorimeter. The scintillation decay time of $\text{PbWO}_{4}$ is of the same order of magnitude as the LHC bunch crossing time:
about 80\% of the light is emitted in 25 ns. In the barrel the crystal cross-section corresponds to approximately 0.0174 $\times$ 0.0174 in $\eta - \phi$, corresponding to a front cross-section 22 $\times$ 22$\text{mm}^2$ and a rear cross-section 26$\times$26$\text{mm}^2$. The crystal length is 230 mm, corresponding to 25.8$X_{0}$. There are 61 200 crystals in the barrel. In the endcaps the crystals have a rear face cross section 30 $\times$ 30$\text{mm}^2$, a front face cross section 28.62 $\times$ 28.62$\text{mm}^2$ and a length of 220 mm 24.7$X_{0}$). Additionally in the fiducial region $1.653 < \left|\eta\right| <2.6$ there is a preshower detector whose principal aim is to identify neutral pions in the endcaps. The energy resolution of the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter depends on the incident energy and is measured from 0.94 \% ($\sigma/E$) at 20\GeV to 0.34 \% at 250\GeV \cite{Adzic:2007mi}. The preshower detector consists of a lead radiator where electromagnetic showers from incoming electrons/photons are initiated. Behind the lead radiator there are silicon strips to measure the deposited energy and transverse shower profiles.

The hadronic calorimeter \cite{HCAL_report} consists of a barrel ($\left|\eta\right| < 1.3 $) and two endcap disks ($1.3 < \left|\eta\right| < 3.0 $). The space of the hadron callorimeter in the central pseudorapidity region is constrained. Therefore, an outer tail catcher layer behind the soleonoid is used. The solenoid is used as an additional absorber for the tail catcher. The absorber consists of a 40 mm -thick front steel plate, followed by eight 50.5 mm-thick brass plates, six 56.5 mm-thick brass plates, and a 75mm-thick steel back plate. The total absorber thickness at 90$^{\circ}$ is 5.82 interaction lengths ($\lambda_{I}$). As the active material plasctic scintillator arranged in tiles is used. Wavelength shifting fibres are used to bring out the light. The hadronic calorimeter is read out in individual towers with a cross section $\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.087\times0.087$ for $\left|\eta\right|<1.6$ and $0.17\times0.17$ at larger pseudorapidities. The hadronic calorimeter at  $\left|\eta\right|$ extending up to $\simeq5.0$ where particle flux and radiation damage is highest is complemented by hadron forward calorimeters. The hadron forward calorimeter consists of a steel absorber composed of grooved plates. Radiation-hard quartz fibres are inserted in the grooves along the beam direction and are read out by photomultipliers. The signals are grouped so as to define calorimeter towers with a cross section $\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.175\times0.175$ over most of the pseudorapidity range. 

The magnet is located behind the calorimeters and the tracker to ensure that as less material as possible is situated between these subdetectors and the interaction point. The length of the magnet is 12.5m and the free-bore radius is 3.15m. The coil delivers a 3.8-4.0T uniform and axial magnetic field to the tracked and the calorimeters. The magnet operates at 4.45K and uses a NbTi superconducting coil. The magnet is characterised by a high stored-energy/mass ratio - 11.6$\frac{kJ}{kg}$.

The muon channel is a very powerful tool for studying interesting HEP processes and has been very important for CMS since the experiment's inception. This is because of the relative ease of detecting muons and because they are minimally affected by radiative losses in the tracker material. Four muon detector planes are located outside the solenoid coil interleaved with three layers of steel yoke \cite{muon_tech_rep}. In the barrel region - $\left|\eta\right|<1.2$ where the muon rate is low, and the 4T magnetic field is uniform and mostly contained in the steel yoke, drift chambers are used. In the endcaps $0.9<\left|\eta\right|<2.4$ where the muon rates and background levels are high and the magnetic field is large and non-uniform, the muon system uses cathode strip chambers (CSC). Because of the uncertainty in the eventual background rates and in the ability of the muon system to measure the correct beam-crossing time when the LHC reaches full luminosity, a complementary, dedicated trigger system consisting of resistive plate chambers (RPC) is added in both the barrel and endcap regions.  The RPCs provide a fast, independent, and highly-segmented trigger with a sharp \pt threshold over a large portion of the rapidity range ($\left|\eta\right|<1.6$) of the muon system. The particle flow reconstruction involves a global trajectory fit across the muon detectors and the inner tracker.
