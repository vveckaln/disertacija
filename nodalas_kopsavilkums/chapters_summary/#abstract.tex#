The colour connection between jets from the decay of top quark pairs is studied using final states with one lepton, two light jets and two b-tagged jets, selected in $\sqrt{s}$ =13\TeV data. Pull angles and projections of particle directions onto a plane formed by two jets are used to study the sensitivity. A colour octet \PW\ toy-model is used to benchmark the performance of the methods.
