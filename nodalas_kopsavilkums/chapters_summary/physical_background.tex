The cross section of top quark pair production in proton-proton collisions at \sqrts=13\TeV is measured at next-to-next leading order to be 746 pb \cite{Khachatryan:2015uqb}. The cross section increases once the center of mass energy is increased as illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:tt_curve_toplhcwg_sep18}.

Using the relationship

\begin{equation}
N=\sigma\int L(t)dt
\end{equation}

at 35.9\fbinv integrated luminosity $26.7\times10^{6}$ of such pairs are expected to be created. 

In the LHC 2 protons collide with an energy large enough to ``squeeze`` the protons so closely together that the quarks in one proton are able to interact with the quarks in the other proton. They interact by exchanging a gluon. By such an exchange the top quark-antiquark pair can be created. Fig. \ref{fig:top_quark_productions} illustrates 3 such scenarios. The gluon exchanged is so energetic as to smash the proton into debris. Such a collision is called inelastic.

The top quark decays exclusively in the weak decay process (Fig. \ref{fig:quark_decay}). In the weak decay \PW\ boson and a quark of different flavour and magnitude of charge $\frac{1}{3}e$ is emitted.

The average of measurements by CDF, \DZERO experiments of Tevatron \cite{Aaltonen:2015cra}, and ATLAS and CMS experiments of LHC \cite{twiki:tt_curve_toplhcwg_sep18} yield the result of the $|V_{tb}|$ term of the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix

\begin{equation}
  |V_{tb}|=1.009\pm0.031.
\end{equation}

This would imply the top quark mixes with (decays by emitting) the \cPqb quark in at least $(0.98)^{2}$ of the cases. The other elements of the CKM matrix are very small \cite{Patrignani:2016xqp}:

\begin{align}
  & |V_{td}|=8.4\times10^{-3}, && |V_{ts}|=40.0\times10^{-3}.
\end{align}

The width of the top quark as measured by the \DZERO collaboration \cite{Abazov:2010tm} with 2.3 \fbinv of integrated luminosity is $\Gamma=1.99^{0.69}_{-0.55}$ GeV. This translates into a lifetime of $\tau_{t}=3.3\times10^{-25}\text{s}$.

This lifetime is smaller than the hadronisation timescale ($1/\Lambda$ $\sim$ $10^{-24}\text{s}$), where $\Lambda^{2}$ is the value of $Q^{2}$ of the exhanged gluon at which the strong coupling constant $\alpha_{s}$ becomes $\sim$ 1, close to its asymptotic value at the confinement barrier. Thus the top quark decays before it hadronises and the experimentalist has a unique opportunity to observe a ``bare'' quark for a very short time.

The lifetime of the top quark is also smaller than the spin decorrelation of the top quark pair $M/{\Lambda^{2}}=3\times 10^{-21}\text{s}$. This means that the top quark pair maintain their spin states before they decay and transfer the spin states to their decay products \cite{Cristinziani:2016vif}.

The branching ratios of the decay of the top quark are essentially those of the decay of the \PW boson. The \PW boson can decay to any of the pair of leptons (\Pe\Pgne, \Pgm\Pgngm, \Pgt\Pgngt) or the pairs of \cPqu, \cPqd' and \cPqc, \cPqs' quarks (where the apostrophe means flavour symmetry is not exactly conserved). However, the quark pairs can have 3 colours. Thus the total number of states is $3+2\times3=9$. A simple estimate and experimentally observed branching ratios from the decay of the \PW boson are given in Table \ref{tab:W_br}.

Colour connected jets are emitted in the hadronic decay of the \PW\ boson (Fig. \ref{fig:ttbar_cf}). The quarks originating these jets have opposite momenta in their COM frame. As the quarks try to separate, their kinetic energy is transfered to the colour field. The extra energy in the colour field equal to about $m_{\PW}$ (80.4\GeV) is expended to create new particles. A simplified portrayal of the birth of new hadrons is given in Fig. \ref{fig:combination}, which is based on the Lund model \cite{Andersson:1983ia}. An alternative portrayal based on Feynman diagrams is given in Fig. \ref{fig:colour_field}.

Since we study light jets from the decay of the \PW boson it is interesting to ask why we need to concentrate on the \ttbar process. The \PW production cross section is $>20\times$ larger than the \ttbar cross section. In the study we need to use  $\PW\rightarrow \cPq\cPq'$ events as the leptonic decays do not have colour flow. It is hard to trigger on resolved $\PW\rightarrow \cPq\cPq'$ events with sufficiently low \pt thresholds, so we use \ttbar events where one of the \PW bosons decays leptonically and it is used to trigger the event while the other one decays hadronically and it is used to study colour flow.

The \PW boson belongs to the colour singlet:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\left(\text{R}\overline{\text{R}}+\text{G}\overline{\text{G}}+\text{B}\overline{\text{B}}\right),
\end{equation}

where $R$, $G$ and $B$ are the three quantum states of the colour wave function.

An object belonging to the colour singlet is colourless and cannot participate in the strong interaction. We mention this feature in light of our subsequent discussion of the colour octet \PW boson.

\section{Colour octet \PW boson}

A \PW boson belonging to the colour octet is assumed. Its colour wavefunctions can take any of the 8 combinations:

\begin{align}
\text{R}\overline{\text{G}}, && \text{R}\overline{\text{B}}, && \text{G}\overline{\text{R}}, && \text{G}\overline{\text{B}}, && \text{B}\overline{\text{R}}, && \text{B}\overline{\text{G}}, && \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\text{R}\overline{\text{R}}-\text{G}\overline{\text{G}}\right), && \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\left(\text{R}\overline{\text{R}}+\text{G}\overline{\text{G}}-2\text{B}\overline{\text{B}}\right)
\end{align}

The only known particle in nature that belongs to the colour octet is the gluon. The colourful \PW boson is a purely hypothetical particle. The mass of the colour octet \PW boson is assumed to be equal to $m_{\PW}$. This boson would couple in colour field the light quarks to the hadronic \cPqb\ and the hadronic \cPqt, while the light quarks would become uncoupled from each other (Fig. \ref{fig:ttbar_cf_octet}).
Although the existence of such a particle has not been confirmed, massive coulor-octet vector bosons (colourons) are predicted in a variety of models, including axigluon models, topcolour models, technicolour models with coloured technifermions, flavour-universal and chiral colouron models, and extra-dimensional models with $KK$ gluons \cite{Chivukula:2013xla}.  These states have also recently been suspected as a potential source (\cite{Ferrario:2009bz}, \cite{Frampton:2009rk}) of the top-quark forward-backward asymmetry observed by the CDF collaboration (\cite{Aaltonen:2008hc}, \cite{Aaltonen:2011kc}). Searches for resonances in the dijet mass spectrum at the LHC at \sqrts=7-8\TeV imply that the lower bound on such a boson is now 2-3 \TeV (\cite{Han:2010rf}, \cite{Haisch:2011up}, \cite{Chatrchyan:2011ns}, \cite{Aad:2011fq}), while more recent LHC searches at \sqrts=13\TeV with integrated luminosity 27 \fbinv\ place an even higher lower bound of 6.1\TeV (\cite{CMS:2017xrr}).
