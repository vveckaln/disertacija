We look for experimental signatures of colour connection between hadron jets resulting from the decay of a top quark pair. The colour connection is enforced by the decay of a colour singlet \PW boson. The top quark pair is produced in \Pp\Pp\ collisions at a center of momentum energy $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$. Observations are conducted at the CMS experiment of the CERN LHC. The most widely studied observable is the pull angle \cite{Gallicchio:2010sw}. Also used is an adaptation of a methodology used at LEP wherein jet constituents are projected onto inter-jet planes \cite{Abbiendi:2005es}, \cite{Abdallah:2006uq}, \cite{Achard:2003pe}. When compared to non-colour connected jets, a distinctive experimental signature of colour connection is revealed. We also experimentally study the observables of colour connection between jets resulting from the decay of a theoretical colour octet \PW\ boson.
